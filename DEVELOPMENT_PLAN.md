# Development Plan

This document outlines possible improvements and future developments for the `TSDataStructure` project.

## Code Quality and Tooling

- **Adopt ESLint**: Replace the deprecated TSLint configuration with ESLint to keep the linting ecosystem up to date. *(Implemented)*
- **Upgrade Dependencies**: Review and update dependencies regularly to keep up with security fixes and improvements. *(Implemented)*
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Consider enabling `strictNullChecks` and other strict compiler options for safer type checking.

## Testing and CI

- **Increase Test Coverage**: Add more unit tests covering edge cases and error conditions for all data structures.
- **Continuous Integration**: Configure a modern CI workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automatically run build and tests on each commit.
- **Coverage Reporting**: Switch from `istanbul` to `nyc` or a modern coverage tool and publish coverage reports. *(Implemented)*

## New Data Structures

- **Graph**: Implement a basic graph structure with common algorithms such as BFS, DFS, and shortest path algorithms. *(Implemented)*
- **PriorityQueue**: Provide a priority queue implementation for efficient task scheduling. *(Implemented)*
- **Balanced Trees**: Add self-balancing tree variants (e.g., AVL or Red-Black trees) for more efficient search and insert operations. *(Implemented)*

## Documentation

- **API Examples**: Expand the README with practical examples demonstrating each data structure in real-world scenarios.
- **Contribution Guide**: Provide a `CONTRIBUTING.md` describing how to set up the project, run tests, and submit pull requests. *(Implemented)*
- **Changelog**: Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` to track notable changes between releases. *(Implemented)*

## Packaging and Distribution

- **Publish to npm**: Ensure the package is published to npm with clear versioning and release notes.
- **Type Declarations**: Generate `.d.ts` files to support TypeScript consumers directly.

## Future Enhancements

- **Performance Benchmarks**: Add benchmarks to evaluate and optimize the performance of the data structures.
- **Browser Support**: Provide build targets that work in browser environments, possibly using bundlers like Rollup or Webpack.
- **Typed Iterators**: Implement iterator interfaces for data structures to integrate seamlessly with ES6 iteration protocols. *(Implemented)*
